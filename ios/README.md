## **Local Installation Instructions:**

1. Download Repo off of Github.
2. Navigate to branch you are testing on.
3. Open up the .xcworkspace file.
4. Add in the GoogleService-Info.plist file.
5. Add in the Config.swift file.
6. Run the app on a device with iOS 9+.

### **Important:**
### Config.swift
To get the livechat service working, you need a Swift file "config.swift" that defines a "Config" object, with properties license and group. This config.swift file is located with the other swift files.

For example: 
```swift
public struct Config {
    static let license = LICENSE_HERE;
    static let group = GROUP_HERE;
}
```

### CSS
LiveChat allows you to modify the look and feel of any given group/deployment by editing CSS in the LiveChat console.
